    <h1>Commonwealth Games</h1>
    <p>
        The Commonwealth Games, often referred to as the Friendly Games,
        [1] is a quadrennial international multi-sport event among athletes from the Commonwealth of Nations.
        The event was first held in 1930, and, with the exception of 1942 and 1946 (cancelled due to World War II), have
        successively
        run every four years since.[2] The Games were called the British Empire Games from 1930 to 1950, the British
        Empire and Commonwealth Games
        from 1954 to 1966, and British Commonwealth Games from 1970 to 1974. Athletes with a disability are included as
        full members of their
        national teams since 2002, making the Commonwealth Games the first fully inclusive international multi-sport
        event.[3] In 2018, the Games
        became the first global multi-sport event to feature an equal number of men's and women's medal events and four
        years later they are the first
        global multi-sport event to have more events for women than men.

        The 1970 British Commonwealth Games were held in Edinburgh, Scotland. This was the first time the name British
        Commonwealth Games was adopted, the first time metric units rather than imperial units were used in events, the
        first time the games were held in Scotland and also the first time that HM Queen Elizabeth II attended in her
        capacity as Head of the Commonwealth.[29]

        The 1974 British Commonwealth Games were held in Christchurch, New Zealand. The Games were officially named "the
        friendly games", and was also the first edition to feature a theme song. Following the massacre of Israeli
        athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics, the tenth games at Christchurch were the first multi-sport event to place
        the safety of participants and spectators as its uppermost requirement. Security guards surrounded the athlete's
        village and there was an exceptionally high-profile police presence. Only 22 countries succeeded in winning
        medals from the total haul of 374 medals on offer, but first time winners included Western Samoa, Lesotho and
        Swaziland (since 2018 named Eswatini).[30] The theme song for the 1974 British Commonwealth Games was called
        "Join Together".
